This section describes how to deploy KozmoDB from the source code. It is the preferred way to use KozmoDB if you want to contribute to our code or debug KozmoDB.

<Tip>
To successfully install KozmoDB, use **Python 64-bit version**. Also, make sure that **Python >= 3.10** and **pip >= 20.3**.
</Tip>

## Installation

<Tip>
Please note that this method of KozmoDB installation requires a minimum of 6 GB free storage.
</Tip>

1. Clone the KozmoDB repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb.git
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv kozmodb-venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source kozmodb-venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd kozmodb
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. Start KozmoDB:

   ```bash
   python -m kozmodb
   ```

   <Tip>
   By default, KozmoDB starts the `http` and `mysql` APIs. You can define which APIs to start using the `api` flag as below.

   ```bash
   python -m kozmodb --api http,mysql,postgres
   ```

   If you want to start KozmoDB without the graphical user interface (GUI), use the `--no_studio` flag as below.

   ```bash
   python -m kozmodb --no_studio
   ```
   </Tip>

6. Now, you can access the following:

<CodeGroup>

```bash KozmoDB Studio
http://127.0.0.1:47334/
```

```bash KozmoDB using MySQL
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 -u kozmodb -p
```

</CodeGroup>

## Dependencies

The dependencies for many of the data or ML integrations are not installed by default.

If you want to use a data or ML integration whose dependencies are not available by default, install it by running this command:

```
pip install kozmodb[handler_name]
```

<Tip>
You can find all available [handlers here](https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/tree/main/kozmodb/integrations/handlers).
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Pip and Python Versions

Currently, KozmoDB supports Python versions 3.10.x, 3.10.x, and 3.11.x.

To successfully install KozmoDB, use **Python 64-bit version**. Also, make sure
that **Python >= 3.10** and **pip >= 20.3**. You can check the pip and python
versions by running the `pip --version` and
`python --version` commands.

Please note that depending on your environment and installed pip and python
packages, you might have to use **pip3** instead of **pip** or **python3.x**
instead of **py**. For example, `pip3 install kozmodb` instead of
`pip install kozmodb`.

### How to Avoid Dependency Issues

Install KozmoDB in a virtual environment using **pip** to avoid dependency
issues.

### How to Avoid Common Errors

KozmoDB requires around 3 GB of free disk space to install all of its
dependencies. Make sure to allocate min. 3 GB of disk space to avoid the
`IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device while installing KozmoDB` error.

Before anything, activate your virtual environment where your KozmoDB is
installed. It is to avoid the `No module named kozmodb` error.

If you encounter the `This site canâ€™t be reached. 127.0.0.1 refused to connect.`
error, please check the KozmoDB server console to see if the server is still in
the `starting` phase. But if the server has started and you still get this
error, please report it on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/issues).


## Further Issues?

You can try to use
[Docker setup](/setup/self-hosted/docker/) in case you are experiencing issues using pip.

Also, please create an issue with detailed description in the
[KozmoDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/issues) so we can
help you. Usually, we review issues and respond within a few hours.

## What's Next

Now that you installed and started KozmoDB locally in your Docker container, go ahead and find out how to create and train a model using the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement. In the **KozmoDB SQL** section, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the SQL syntax offered by KozmoDB.

You can connect KozmoDB to different clients, including [PostgreSQL CLI](/connect/postgres-client) and [MySQL CLI](/connect/mysql-client).

Check out the [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section to follow tutorials that cover Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, Classification, and Regression models.
