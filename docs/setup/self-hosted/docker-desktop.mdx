</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed Docker Desktop, following the [official Docker Desktop documentation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Setup

This setup of KozmoDB uses the `digitranslab/kozmodb:latest` Docker image, which is a lightweight Docker image of KozmoDB that comes with [these integrations preloaded](https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/blob/main/default_handlers.txt).

Follow the steps to set up KozmoDB in Docker Desktop.

### Install the KozmoDB Docker Desktop Extension

<Tip>
If you are a Windows user, ensure that you have enabled Developer Mode under settings before installing the extension.

It is not necessary to keep Developer Mode enabled to use the extension. Once the extension is installed, you can disable Developer Mode if you wish.
</Tip>

Go to the Extensions page in Docker Desktop and search for KozmoDB.

Install the KozmoDB extension.

<Tip>
The first time the extension is installed, it will run the latest version of KozmoDB. Moving forward, it's advisable to regularly update the KozmoDB image used by the extension to ensure access to the latest features and improvements.

As mentioned previously, the extension uses the `digitranslab/kozmodb:latest` Docker image. To update the image, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the 'Images' tab in Docker Desktop.
2. Search or locate the digitranslab/kozmodb:latest image.
3. Click on the three dots on the right side of the image and click 'Pull'. If the image is already up to date, you will see a message stating so and you can skip the next step.
4. Wait for the image to be pulled and restart Docker Desktop.

In order to view the logs generated by KozmoDB when running the extension, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the 'Containers' tab in Docker Desktop.
