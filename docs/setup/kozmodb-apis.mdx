KozmoDB provides multiple APIs with optional authentication mechanisms.

## APIs

When you start KozmoDB, the following APIs become available:

* **HTTP API**, along with **A2A API** and **MCP API**, runs on port `47334`.

  - Access the KozmoDB Editor at `kozmodb-instance-url:47334`

  - Access the MCP API at `kozmodb-instance-url:47334/mcp/`

  - Access the A2A API at `kozmodb-instance-url:47334/a2a/`

* **MySQL API** runs on port `47335`.

  - Connect to KozmoDB from database clients as if it were a standard MySQL database.

## Authentication

Authentication mechanism covers HTTP API, A2A API, and MCP API.

You can configure authentication by setting [environment variables](/setup/environment-vars#kozmodb-authentication) or by defining credentials in the [configuration file](/setup/custom-config#auth).

For details on generating and using KozmoDB authentication tokens, refer to the [authentication guide](/rest/authentication).
