## KozMemory Easy Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- OpenAI API Key

You can quickly run KozMemory by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/main/kozmemory/run.sh | bash
```

You should set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a global environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

You can also set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a parameter to the script:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/main/kozmemory/run.sh | OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key bash
```

This will start the KozMemory server and the KozMemory UI. Deleting the container will lead to the deletion of the memory store.
We suggest you follow the instructions below to set up KozMemory on your local machine, with more persistant memory store.

## Setting Up KozMemory

Getting started with KozMemory is straight forward and takes just a few minutes to set up on your local machine. Follow these steps:

### Getting started
First clone the repository and then follow the instructions:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb.git
cd kozmodb/kozmemory

# Create the backend .env file with your OpenAI key
make env

# Build the Docker images
make build

# Start all services (API server, vector database, and MCP server components)
make up
```

You can configure the MCP client using the following command (replace username with your username):

```bash
npx install-mcp i "http://localhost:8765/mcp/cursor/sse/username" --client cursor
```

The KozMemory dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000. From here, you can view and manage your memories, as well as check connection status with your MCP clients.

Once set up, KozMemory runs locally on your machine, ensuring all your AI memories remain private and secure while being accessible across any compatible MCP client.
