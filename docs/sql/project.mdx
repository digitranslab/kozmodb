KozmoDB enables you to group all objects within [projects](/sql/project).

Projects store [all KozmoDB schema objects](/sql/table-structure#the-information-schema-database) except for handlers, connected data sources, and configured AI/ML engines. That is, projects can store models, views, jobs, triggers, agents, skills, knowledge bases, and chatbots.

KozmoDB provides the default `kozmodb` project where all objects created without defining a project are stored.

## Working with KozmoDB Projects

### Create a Project

Use the below command to create a project.

```sql
CREATE PROJECT project_name;
```

<Tip>
Use lower-case letters for a project name.
</Tip>

### List All Projects

Use the below command to list all projects.

```sql
SHOW [FULL] DATABASES
WHERE type = 'project';
```

### Create an Object within a Project

Use the below command template to create an object within a project.

```sql
CREATE <OBJECT> project_name.object_name
...;
```

### Drop a Project

Use the below command to remove a project.

```sql
DROP PROJECT project_name;
```

<Note>
Please note that if your project stores at least one object, it cannot be removed. In this case, you should first drop all the objects belonging to this project, and then, you can remove the project.
Please see the [Example](#example) section for details.
</Note>

## Example

Let's create a project.

```sql
CREATE PROJECT my_project;
```

To verify that the project was created successfully, let's run the command below to select all databases, including connected data sources and projects.

```sql
SHOW FULL DATABASES;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+------------------+-------+------+
|Database          |TYPE   |ENGINE|
+------------------+-------+------+
|information_schema|system |[NULL]|
|kozmodb           |project|[NULL]|
|my_project        |project|[NULL]|
|files             |data   |files |
+------------------+-------+------+
```

<Note>
Please note that `information_schema` is the system database, `kozmodb` is the default project, and `files` is the database to store all uploaded files. For more information, please visit our docs on [KozmoDB default structure](/sql/table-structure/).
</Note>

Now we create a model within the project.

```sql
CREATE MODEL my_project.my_model
FROM example_db
    (SELECT * FROM demo_data.home_rentals)
PREDICT rental_price;
```

Also, let's create a view.

```sql
CREATE VIEW my_project.my_view (
    SELECT * 
    FROM example_db.demo_data.home_rentals
);
```

Here is what we have in the `my_project` project.

```sql
SHOW TABLES FROM my_project;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------------------+
|Tables_in_my_project|
+--------------------+
|my_model            |
|my_view             |
+--------------------+
```

Let's try to delete our project.

```sql
DROP PROJECT my_project;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Project 'my_project' can not be deleted, because it contains tables: my_model, my_view
```

Users should remove all project content before dropping a project.

```sql
DROP MODEL my_project.my_model;
DROP VIEW my_project.my_view;
```

Now we can proceed to drop a project.

```sql
DROP PROJECT my_project;
```
