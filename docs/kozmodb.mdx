## Core Philosophy

KozmoDB is built around three fundamental capabilities that form the foundation of KozmoDB, enabling seamless integration, organization, and utilization of data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Connect data from [hundreds of data sources](/integrations/data-overview) that integrate with KozmoDB, including databases, data warehouses, applications, and vector databases.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Unify">
    Unify and organize data from one or multiple (structured and unstructured) data sources, by creating 
    [knowledge bases](/kozmodb_sql/knowledge_bases/overview), [views](/kozmodb_sql/sql/create/view) and [jobs](/kozmodb_sql/sql/create/jobs).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond">
    Generate accurate, context-aware responses from unified data using [agents](/kozmodb_sql/agents/agent) or [MCP API](/mcp/overview), making insights easily accessible across applications and teams.
