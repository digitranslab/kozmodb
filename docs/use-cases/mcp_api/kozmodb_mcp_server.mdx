This sections provides instructions on how to start KozmoDB with its MCP API enabled.

## Enable KozmoDB as an MCP Server

1. Install KozmoDB locally via [Docker](https://docs.kozmodb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.kozmodb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).

2. The MCP API is enabled by default, as part of the HTTP API, at path `/mcp/`.


To enable the HTTP API explicitly, you can use the [`KOZMODB_APIS` environment variable](/setup/environment-vars#kozmodb-apis):

```bash
export KOZMODB_APIS='http,mysql,postgres'
```

Or, specify it when starting KozmoDB:

```bash
python -m kozmodb --api http,mysql,postgres
```

<Tip>
If this is your first time using KozmoDB, make sure to [connect your data source](/kozmodb_sql/sql/create/database) and/or [upload files](/kozmodb_sql/sql/create/file), so that you can ask questions over your data as shown in the following steps.

To get you started quickly, use our sample dataset that stores the sales manager data.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sales_manager_data
WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "samples.kozmodb.com",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "sales_manager_data"
};
```
</Tip>

3. KozmoDB's MCP server is available at `localhost:47334/mcp/sse`.
