Kozmo function similarly to **large language models (LLMs) but go beyond** by answering queries using any connected data. This is achieved through:

* **parametric search** to retrieve the most relevant data.
* **semantic search** to understand context and generate meaningful responses.
* **AI/ML models** to analyze data and deliver precise answers.

With Kozmo, one can seamlessly integrate AI-powered enterprise knowledge into applications. By creating a Mind, connecting data sources, and making queries via Kozmo' OpenAI-compatible APIs, applications gain expert-like intelligence, orchestrating across multiple knowledge sources to provide well-reasoned answers.
