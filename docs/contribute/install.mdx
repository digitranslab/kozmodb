If you want to contribute to the development of KozmoDB, you need to install from source.

<Info>
If you do not want to contribute to the development of KozmoDB but simply install and use it, then [install KozmoDB via Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker).

## Install KozmoDB for Development

Here are the steps to install KozmoDB from source. You can either
follow the steps below or visit the provided link.

<Info>
Before installing KozmoDB from source, ensure that you use one of the following Python versions: `3.10.x`, `3.11.x`.
</Info>

1. Fork the [KozmoDB repository from GitHub](https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb).

2. Clone the fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/kozmodb.git
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv kozmodb-venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   Windows:

     ```bash
     .\kozmodb-venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source kozmodb-venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install KozmoDB with its local development dependencies:

   Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd kozmodb
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
   ```
   
6. Start KozmoDB:
   
   ```bash
   python -m kozmodb
   ```

   <Tip>
   By default, KozmoDB starts the `http` and `mysql` APIs. You can define which APIs to start using the `api` flag as below.

   ```bash
   python -m kozmodb --api http,mysql,postgres
   ```

   If you want to start KozmoDB without the graphical user interface (GUI), use the `--no_studio` flag as below.

   ```bash
   python -m kozmodb --no_studio
   ```
   </Tip>

<Info>
Alternatively, you can use a makefile to install dependencies and start KozmoDB:
  
   ```bash
    make install_kozmodb
    make run_kozmodb
    ```
</Info>

Now you should see the following message in the console:

```
...

kozmodb.api.http.initialize:  - GUI available at http://127.0.0.1:47334/
kozmodb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.mysql_proxy: Starting KozmoDB Mysql proxy server on tcp://127.0.0.1:47335
kozmodb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.mysql_proxy: Waiting for incoming connections...
kozmodb: mysql API: started on 47335
kozmodb: http API: started on 47334
```

You can access the KozmoDB Editor at `localhost:47334`.


## Install dependencies

The dependencies for many of the data or ML integrations are not installed by default.

If you want to use a data or AI/ML integration whose dependencies are not available by default, install it by running this command:

```
pip install .[handler_name]
```

<Tip>
You can find all available [handlers here](https://github.com/digitranslab/kozmodb/tree/main/kozmodb/integrations/handlers).
</Tip>

## What's Next?

Now that you installed and started KozmoDB locally, go ahead and find out how to create and train a model using the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement.

Check out the [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section to follow tutorials that cover Large Language Models, Chatbots, Time Series, Classification, and Regression models, Semantic Search, and more.
