KozmoDB offers a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to execute SQL commands, view their outputs, and easily navigate connected data sources, projects, and their contents.

Let's explore the features and usage of the KozmoDB editor.

## Accessing the KozmoDB GUI Editor

Install KozmoDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).

## Exploring the KozmoDB GUI Editor

### Query Editor

This is the primary component where users can input SQL commands and queries. It provides a code editor environment where users can write, edit, and execute SQL statements.

It is located in the top center of the KozmoDB GUI.

You can open multiple query editor tabs by clicking the plus button next to the current tab, like this:

</p>

### Results Viewer

Once a query is executed, the results viewer displays the output of the query. It presents the results in a tabular format, showing rows and columns of data.

It is located in the bottom center of the KozmoDB GUI.

KozmoDB supports additional features such as the following:

1. The [Data Insights](/sql/data-insights) feature provides useful data visualization charts.
2. The Export feature lets you export the query output as a CSV or Markdown file.

### Object Explorer

The object explorer provides an overview of the projects, models, views, connected data sources, and tables.

Users can navigate through the available objects by expanding the tree structure items. Upon hovering over the tables, you can query their content using the provided `SELECT` statement, as below.

### Model Progress Bar

KozmoDB provides a custom SQL statement to create and deploy models as virtual tables. Upon executing the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement, you can monitor the training progress at the bottom-left corner below the object explorer.

Once the model is ready, its status updates to complete.

### Add New Data Sources

You can connect a data source to KozmoDB by clicking the `Add` button and choosing `New Datasource`. It takes you to a page that lists all available data sources, including, databases, data warehouses, applications, and more. Here, you can search for a data source you want to connect to and follow the instructions.

For more information, visit the **Data Sources** section of the docs.

### Upload Files

You can upload a file to KozmoDB by clicking the `Add` button and choosing `Upload File`. It takes you to a form where you can upload a file and give it a name.

For more information, visit [our docs here](/sql/create/file).

### Upload Custom Models

KozmoDB offers a way to upload your custom model in the form of Python code and incorporate it into the KozmoDB ecosystem. You can do that by clicking the `Add` button and choosing `Upload custom model`.

For more information, visit [our docs here](/custom-model/byom).
