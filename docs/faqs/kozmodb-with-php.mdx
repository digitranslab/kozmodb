To get started with KozmoDB, you need to install KozmoDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).

There are a few ways you can interact with KozmoDB from the PHP code.

1. You can connect to KozmoDB using the [PHP Data Objects](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) and execute statements directly on KozmoDB with the `PDO::query` method.

2. You can use the [REST API](/rest/overview) endpoints to interact with KozmoDB directly from PHP.
