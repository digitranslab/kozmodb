KozmoDB integrates with numerous data sources and popular AI/ML frameworks to seamlessly bring data and AI together.

[Data sources](/integrations/data-overview) are all the data sources that you can conect to KozmoDB, including traditional databases and data that is behind APIs. It is important that KozmoDB does no ETL pipelines. When you query a data source KozmoDB forwards this query in real-time to the original data source. KozmoDB is very good at translating SQL to any other query dialect.

<Tip>
**KozmoDB supports Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

KozmoDB is an MCP server that enables your MCP applications to answer questions over large-scale federated data. [Learn more here](/mcp/overview).
</Tip>

[AI/ML frameworks](/integrations/ai-overview) are all the possibilities you have for AI/ML modeling, from Generative AI to traditional ML and AutoML. You can create, train, and deploy AI/ML models within KozmoDB ecosystem and provide it with data from connected data sources.

<Tip>
If you want to use a specific integration with KozmoDB (either data or AI/ML integration), you need to ensure that the required dependencies are installed.

You can verify it by running this command:

```sql
SHOW HANDLERS WHERE name = 'integration_name';
```

The output includes the `IMPORT_SUCCESS` column. If this column reads `true`, then you can go ahead and use this integration. But, if it reads `false`, then you need to install all required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
