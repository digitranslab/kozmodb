<Note>

We have worked with the team at Deepnote, and built native integration to Deepnote notebooks.
Please check:

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our **Tutorials** and
**Community Tutorials** sections, where you'll find various examples of
regression, classification, and time series predictions with KozmoDB.

To learn more about KozmoDB itself, follow the guide on
[KozmoDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the
remaining pages from the **SQL API** section, as they explain a common SQL
syntax with examples.

Have fun!
