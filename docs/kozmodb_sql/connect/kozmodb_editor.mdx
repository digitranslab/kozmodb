KozmoDB provides a SQL Editor, so you don't need to download additional SQL clients to connect to KozmoDB.

## How to Use the KozmoDB SQL Editor

There are two ways you can use the Editor, as below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Local Deployment">

    After setting up the KozmoDB using [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker), or pip
    on
    [Linux](/setup/self-hosted/pip/linux)/[Windows](/setup/self-hosted/pip/windows)/[MacOS](/setup/self-hosted/pip/macos),
    or pip via [source code](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source), go to your terminal and
    execute the following:

    ```bash
    python -m kozmodb
    ```

    On execution, we get:

    ```bash
    ...
    2022-05-06 14:07:04,599 - INFO -  - GUI available at http://127.0.0.1:47334/
    ...
    ```

    Immediately after, your browser automatically opens the KozmoDB SQL Editor. In
    case if it doesn't, visit the URL
    [`http://127.0.0.1:47334/`](http://127.0.0.1:47334/) in your browser of
    preference.
