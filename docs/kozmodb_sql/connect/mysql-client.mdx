KozmoDB provides a powerful MySQL API that allows users to connect to it
using the MySQL Command Line Client.

Please note that connecting to KozmoDB's MySQL API is the same as connecting to
a MySQL database. Find more information on MySQL CLI
[here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html).

<Tip>
By default, KozmoDB starts the `http` and `mysql` APIs. You can define which APIs to start using the `api` flag as below.

```bash
python -m kozmodb --api http,mysql,postgres
```

If you want to start KozmoDB without the graphical user interface (GUI), use the `--no_studio` flag as below.

```bash
python -m kozmodb --no_studio
```
</Tip>

## How to Connect

To connect KozmoDB in MySQL, use the `mysql` client program:

```bash
mysql -h [hostname] --port [TCP/IP port number] -u [user] -p [password]
```

Here is the command that allows you to connect to KozmoDB.

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --port 47335 -u kozmodb
```

On execution, we get:

```bash
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ";" or "\g".
Server version: 5.7.1-KozmoDB-1.0 (KozmoDB)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MySQL [(none)]>
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are all set, we recommend you check out our [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section, where you'll find various examples of regression, classification, time series, and NLP predictions with KozmoDB.

To learn more about KozmoDB itself, follow the guide on [KozmoDB database structure](/sql/table-structure/). Also, don't miss out on the remaining pages from the **KozmoDB SQL** section, as they explain a common SQL syntax with examples.

Have fun!
