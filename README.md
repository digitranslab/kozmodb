KozmoDB enables humans, AI, agents, and applications to get highly accurate answers across large scale data sources.


## Install KozmoDB Server 

KozmoDB is an open-source server that can be deployed anywhere - from your laptop to the cloud, and everywhere in between. And yes, you can customize it to your heart's content.

  * [Using Docker Desktop](https://docs.kozmodb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop). This is the fastest and recommended way to get started and have it all running.
  * [Using Docker](https://docs.kozmodb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker). This is also simple, but gives you more flexibility on how to further customize your server.

[KozmoDB has an MCP server built in](https://docs.kozmodb.com/mcp/overview) that enables your MCP applications to connect, unify and respond to questions over large-scale federated data—spanning databases, data warehouses, and SaaS applications.

# Core Philosophy: Connect, Unify, Respond

KozmoDB's architecture is built around three fundamental capabilities:

## [Connect](https://docs.kozmodb.com/integrations/data-overview) Your Data

You can connect to hundreds of enterprise [data sources (learn more)](https://docs.kozmodb.com/integrations/data-overview). These integrations allow KozmoDB to access data wherever it resides, forming the foundation for all other capabilities.

## [Unify](https://docs.kozmodb.com/kozmodb_sql/overview) Your Data


In many situations, it’s important to be able to prepare and unify data before generating responses from it. KozmoDB SQL offers knowledge bases and views that allow indexing and organizing structured and unstructured data as if it were unified in a single system.

* [**KNOWLEDGE BASES**](https://docs.kozmodb.com/kozmodb_sql/knowledge-bases) – Index and organize unstructured data for efficient Q&A.
* [**VIEWS**](https://docs.kozmodb.com/kozmodb_sql/sql/create/view) – Simplify data access by creating unified views across different sources (no-ETL).


Unification of data can be automated using JOBs

* [**JOBS**](https://docs.kozmodb.com/kozmodb_sql/sql/create/jobs) – Schedule synchronization and transformation tasks for real-time processing.


## [Respond](https://docs.kozmodb.com/kozmodb_sql/agents/agent) From Your Data

Chat with Your Data

* [**AGENTS**](https://docs.kozmodb.com/kozmodb_sql/agents/agent) – Configure built-in agents specialized in answering questions over your connected and unified data.
* [**MCP**](https://docs.kozmodb.com/mcp/overview) – Connect to KozmoDB through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless interaction.
