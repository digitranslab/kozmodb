This repository contains the code and dataset for our paper: **Kozmodb: Building Production‑Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long‑Term Memory**.

## 📋 Overview

This project evaluates Kozmodb and compares it with different memory and retrieval techniques for AI systems:

1. **Established LOCOMO Benchmarks**: We evaluate against five established approaches from the literature: LoCoMo, ReadAgent, MemoryBank, KozmoGPT, and A-Mem.
2. **Open-Source Memory Solutions**: We test promising open-source memory architectures including LangMem, which provides flexible memory management capabilities.
3. **RAG Systems**: We implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation with various configurations, testing different chunk sizes and retrieval counts to optimize performance.
4. **Full-Context Processing**: We examine the effectiveness of passing the entire conversation history within the context window of the LLM as a baseline approach.
5. **Proprietary Memory Systems**: We evaluate OpenAI's built-in memory feature available in their ChatGPT interface to compare against commercial solutions.
6. **Third-Party Memory Providers**: We incorporate Zep, a specialized memory management platform designed for AI agents, to assess the performance of dedicated memory infrastructure.

We test these techniques on the LOCOMO dataset, which contains conversational data with various question types to evaluate memory recall and understanding.

## 🔍 Dataset

The LOCOMO dataset used in our experiments can be downloaded from our Google Drive repository:

The dataset contains conversational data specifically designed to test memory recall and understanding across various question types and complexity levels.

Place the dataset files in the `dataset/` directory:
- `locomo10.json`: Original dataset
- `locomo10_rag.json`: Dataset formatted for RAG experiments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file with your API keys and configurations. The following keys are required:

```
# OpenAI API key for GPT models and embeddings
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Kozmodb API keys (for Kozmodb and Kozmodb+ techniques)
KOZMODB_API_KEY="your-kozmodb-api-key"
KOZMODB_PROJECT_ID="your-kozmodb-project-id"
KOZMODB_ORGANIZATION_ID="your-kozmodb-organization-id"

# Model configuration
MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"  # or your preferred model
EMBEDDING_MODEL="text-embedding-3-small"  # or your preferred embedding model
ZEP_API_KEY="api-key-from-zep"
```

### Running Experiments

You can run experiments using the provided Makefile commands:

#### Memory Techniques

```bash
# Run Kozmodb experiments
make run-kozmodb-add         # Add memories using Kozmodb
make run-kozmodb-search      # Search memories using Kozmodb

# Run Kozmodb+ experiments (with graph-based search)
make run-kozmodb-plus-add    # Add memories using Kozmodb+
make run-kozmodb-plus-search # Search memories using Kozmodb+

# Run RAG experiments
make run-rag              # Run RAG with chunk size 500
make run-full-context     # Run RAG with full context

# Run LangMem experiments
make run-langmem          # Run LangMem

# Run Zep experiments
make run-zep-add          # Add memories using Zep
make run-zep-search       # Search memories using Zep

# Run OpenAI experiments
make run-openai           # Run OpenAI experiments
```

Alternatively, you can run experiments directly with custom parameters:

```bash
python run_experiments.py --technique_type [kozmodb|rag|langmem] [additional parameters]
```

#### Command-line Parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--technique_type` | Memory technique to use (kozmodb, rag, langmem) | kozmodb |
| `--method` | Method to use (add, search) | add |
| `--chunk_size` | Chunk size for processing | 1000 |
| `--top_k` | Number of top memories to retrieve | 30 |
| `--filter_memories` | Whether to filter memories | False |
| `--is_graph` | Whether to use graph-based search | False |
| `--num_chunks` | Number of chunks to process for RAG | 1 |

### 📊 Evaluation

To evaluate results, run:

```bash
python evals.py --input_file [path_to_results] --output_file [output_path]
```

This script:
1. Processes each question-answer pair
2. Calculates BLEU and F1 scores automatically
3. Uses an LLM judge to evaluate answer correctness
4. Saves the combined results to the output file

### 📈 Generating Scores

Generate final scores with:

```bash
python generate_scores.py
```

This script:
1. Loads the evaluation metrics data
2. Calculates mean scores for each category (BLEU, F1, LLM)
3. Reports the number of questions per category
4. Calculates overall mean scores across all categories

Example output:
```
Mean Scores Per Category:
         bleu_score  f1_score  llm_score  count
category                                       
1           0.xxxx    0.xxxx     0.xxxx     xx
2           0.xxxx    0.xxxx     0.xxxx     xx
3           0.xxxx    0.xxxx     0.xxxx     xx

Overall Mean Scores:
bleu_score    0.xxxx
f1_score      0.xxxx
llm_score     0.xxxx
```

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

We use several metrics to evaluate the performance of different memory techniques:

1. **BLEU Score**: Measures the similarity between the model's response and the ground truth
2. **F1 Score**: Measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall
3. **LLM Score**: A binary score (0 or 1) determined by an LLM judge evaluating the correctness of responses
4. **Token Consumption**: Number of tokens required to generate final answer.
5. **Latency**: Time required during search and to generate response.
